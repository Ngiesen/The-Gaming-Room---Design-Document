# The-Gaming-Room---Design-Document
Software design document used to demonstrates ability to be effective in working through the design of a software application and to communicate it effectively to a client and fellow development team members

The Gaming Room (client) had challenge at hand is to develop a web-based game application called "Draw It or Lose It" which is akin to the 1980s television game "Win, Lose or Draw." In this game, teams compete to guess what is being drawn, but instead of players manually drawing on an easel, the application renders images from a stock library as clues. The game comprises four rounds, each lasting one minute, with drawings being fully rendered by the 30-second mark. If a team fails to guess the puzzle in time, other teams get a chance to guess within a 15-second time limit.

In developing the documentation, I effectively outlined the game mechanics and flow. Clear explanations of the four-round structure and consequences of failing to guess in time ensured clarity. The design document served as a roadmap throughout development, allowing me to visualize the application's architecture and plan for necessary features. Enhancing the user interaction and interface design section would provide deeper insight into user experience considerations, ensuring intuitive controls and clear visual cues. I interpreted the client's needs by nderstanding and implementing user needs into the software design was paramount for creating an engaging experience. Employing techniques like user story mapping and wireframing helped prioritize features based on impact and visualize the user journey.

Moving forward, I continue using these techniques while incorporating iterative design processes to refine the application effectively. This iterative approach ensures the final product meets user needs and delivers a satisfying gaming experience.
